# Launching Soon - UX Portfolio

This repository contains the code for **Launching Soon**, a UX portfolio website for [Your Name].

## Contents

- **index.html** – The main HTML file for the one-page portfolio website.
- **style.css** – The external CSS stylesheet that styles the portfolio.
- **README.md** – This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Usage

1. **Download or Clone** – Download the ZIP of this repository or clone it to your local machine.
2. **Customize Content** – Open `index.html` in a text editor and replace the placeholder content:
   - Replace `[Your Name]` with your name.
   - Update the **About Me** section with your background and personal design principles if desired.
   - In the **Projects** section, update the description and features of *FocusNotebook* (or any other projects) with your own project details.
   - Replace the placeholder email and LinkedIn URL in the **Contact** section with your actual contact information.
3. **Review** – Open `index.html` in a web browser to preview the site. Ensure all links and content look correct. The site is a single-page layout; clicking on navigation links (Home, About Me, Projects, Contact) will jump to those sections on the page.
4. **Publish** – Upload all files (including `index.html`, `style.css`, and `README.md`) to your GitHub Pages repository (for example, `yourusername.github.io` repository or the `gh-pages` branch of a repository). GitHub Pages will automatically host the site. After uploading, visit `https://yourusername.github.io/` (or the appropriate URL for your repository) to see the live site.

## Project Sections

- **Home:** A clean introduction on the home page, stating the portfolio owner's name and mission.
- **About Me:** Background information and a list of key UX design principles that the designer follows (with an emphasis on accessibility and inclusive design).
- **Projects:** A section showcasing projects. 
- **Contact:** Contact information for reaching out to the designer, including email and LinkedIn. (Placeholder contact info is provided and should be replaced with real info.)

## Design and Accessibility

This site uses a simple, clean design to keep the focus on content:
- Semantic HTML elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`) are used for better accessibility and SEO. Using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose improves accessibility&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- The layout is responsive and mobile-friendly by using a flexible navigation menu and a centered content column.
- High-contrast colors (dark text on a light background, and light text on a dark nav bar) are used to ensure readability.
- Navigation links are accessible via keyboard (they receive a highlight on focus) and use descriptive text.
- All external links (e.g., LinkedIn) open in a new tab for convenience (using `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener"` for security).

## Notes

Feel free to adjust the styling in `style.css` to personalize the look and feel of your portfolio. Add any images (such as a profile picture or project screenshots) to enhance the site; just remember to include `alt` text for accessibility.

This project structure is ready to be published on GitHub Pages or any static site hosting service. All you need to do is customize the content and deploy it.
